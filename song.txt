But it’s easier for me to move through walls
once they’re there,
easier to make a sound from silence,
easier to choose hell when there’s heaven,
easier to lie when there’s truth,
easier to begin when there’s an end.
easier to begin when there’s an end

hat’s why I love my city
though it finds my tits not pretty,
though it b.

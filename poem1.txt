Itâ€™s easier for me to move through walls when they are real.

You can dig up a hole in the universe
and all light will believe it would die there.
And all light will agree it would be its grave.
My darkness is shaded and sticky
and all light is its slave
that falls in love with it.

Flying is not fun at all
